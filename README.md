# Word Guesser! 

This application will be a lot like hangman - you get a predetermined word or phrase and the user must click the letter buttons to attempt guessing the word or phrase. Criteria below!

## Basic

- Words only
- Users get half as many incorrect guesses as the length of the word (rounded down)
    - Ex: The word is "curry" they would be allowed 2 incorrect guesses
- Buttons do not change color once they have been chosen
- No need for "already guessed letters"

## Advanced

- Words and phrases
- Users get half as many incorrect guesses as the length of the word (rounded down)
    - Ex: The word is "curry" they would be allowed 2 incorrect guesses
    - Spaces and special characters do not count in the length
- Spaces and special characters are shown to the users from the beginning
    - Ex: "You're cool" will be "_ _ _ ' _ _ &nbsp; _ _ _ _" at the start of the game
- Add a restart game button (without refreshing the page!)

## Super Advanced!!!

Seriously don't do this unless you have a TON of time AND patience lol

- All functionality of Advanced game
- All OOP
- Implement a Game, World, and Letter class to run the game

&nbsp; is a space character in markdown if you can see it as "&nbsp;" press ctrl+shift+v to see the markdown preview so that this formats correctly
